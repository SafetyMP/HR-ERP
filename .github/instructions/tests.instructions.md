# Test standards (September 2026)

- Ship behavior with a test in the existing layout (co-located `*.test.ts` or `tests/`).
- Do not skip, delete, or weaken verify, lint, typecheck, or adversarial gates to land a change.
- Do not invent a passing gate from prose. Run the documented verify command.
- Fixtures are synthetic. Never commit real PII, PHI, payroll, or credentials.

## This repository

- Definition of Done: `./scripts/harness/verify.sh`.
- Also run `npm run governance:lint` / `governance:ci` when touching governance paths.
